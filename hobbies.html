                            <section id="mike">
                <p>We met when we were working at a biotech company in research park in 2009. He was in a different department than me, but his work bench was close to mine. I had my eye on him from the moment I saw him. About 2 months after I started working there, I finally decided to introduce myself and ask him out. He accepted and we went to dinner. We went on another date in December 2009 and then stopped contacting each other. I assumed he wasn't interested, but still said hello when I saw him at work. In July of 2011, he asked me to dinner. I accepted, thinking it would be just as friends. After that date, we were inseparable! He proposed on Thanksgiving 2011 and we were married in April of 2012. After that we spent a couple of years traveling and working. Mike had always wanted to get his PhD, but decided to pursue a Master's in Plant Science at the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho. We moved there in January 2014 when I was 5 months pregnant with Liam. After his graduation in June 2016, we moved back to Utah and bought our first house in 2017. We have stayed in Layton ever since.</p>
