    <h1>About Me</h1>
</header>
<main>
    <p>I love to travel! Paris is my favorite place. I love Hello Kitty. My family is the BEST! I have the sweetest boys in the entire world and I am married to the love of my life. I am a lucky girl! I live in Layton, Utah and have lived here for the majority of my life. I hate winter! I know that we have the greatest snow on earth, but that is only if you don't have to drive in it.
